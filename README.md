Bitcoin Transaction with second verification
This picture shows a bitcoin transaction with a second function to improve the securtiy for a bitcoin transaction.
The first step of the transaction is exactly the same of the white paper of Satoshi, but the second step could be a 2FA or a second privat key or another function, which the transaction will stop or allow.
In a first step the transaction is fired, when the privat key is the right one, but the transaction is not received by the receiver yet. When another privat key, or 2FA or something else is right, than the transaction goes to the receiver, otherwise the transaction goes back to the sender.
If somebody has an idea, what this second function could be else than 2FA or second privat key, than please write it here.
Thanks,
